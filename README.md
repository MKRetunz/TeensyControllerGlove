# TeensyControllerGlove

A project by Martijn Klok, 

The code included in this project is used to turn rotations of the YPR, namely Pitch and Roll specifically, into movements of the mouse, this was made for primary use on a glove so that the hand movements equal to move movement. 
Besides that there are two buttons, one to activate the right mouse button and another to press the escape button. While the former is used to click and, in the game this controller was made for, attack the latter is used to pause said game.
